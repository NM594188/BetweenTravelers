- ðŸŽ† Hi, I was surprised to come here, everything I want is available here :) )
- ðŸŽƒ By the way, my name is Jeepzai Lover, the shy wild boy~.
- ðŸŽ­ Here although I wear a mask, I'm here to be the most real me~~.
- ðŸŒˆI'm interested in #TON #Development #Programming #Metaverse and I want to learn everything here, but for me with bad English, I think it will take a little time~~.
- ðŸŽ® I want to learn about TelegramBot because it will give me a good start, bla bla bla, I don't know code at all ~~~~
- ðŸ’ŽThe current direction of the bot is in the "link TON wallet, it can send checks with random numbers in the group, set this check 4-10 people compete to get it, the amount is random, so we can have a TON bot with a tail number mine ~~~~ accidentally get the tail number just the number filled by the sender of this check, then the person will pay double, and the opposite will not be punished, first the person who participates needs to have enough TON, otherwise they can't get this check
- ðŸ›« Any help or advice is greatly appreciated!
